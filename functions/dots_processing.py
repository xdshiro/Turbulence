"""
This script provides various functions for processing and visualizing singularity dots in 3D optical fields.
It includes functions for building, loading, plotting, and filtering dots based on their neighborhood configurations.

## Main Functions

### buildSaveTrefoil
1) Creates a mesh grid.
2) Generates a beam with specified coefficients and modes.
3) Detects singularity dots in the beam.
4) Saves the detected dots to files.

### loadDots
Loads dots data from saved files.

### plotDots
Plots the array of dots in an interactive 3D visualization using Plotly.
Parameters:
- dots: array of dots.
- dots_bound: used to get the box frames for the plot.
- show: whether to display the plot in the browser.
- color: color of the dots.
- size: size of the dots.
- width: width of the shell of the dots for better visualization.
- fig: figure to combine with other plots.

### plotDots_Hopf
Similar to plotDots but includes options for plotting lines.

### neighboursDots
Finds all dots in a 3x3x3 cube around a given dot, returning their count and the dots themselves.

### filter_ZeroNeighbours
Filters out dots with zero neighbors.

### filter_OneNeighbours
Filters out dots with one neighbor.

### filter_TwoNeighbours
Filters out dots with two neighbors and checks the trajectory sharpness.

### filter_ThreeNeighbours
Filters out dots with three neighbors and checks the trajectory sharpness.

### filter_PlaneThreeClusters
Finds 3-cluster planes and returns an average dot.

### filter_PlaneTwoClusters
Finds 2-cluster planes and returns average dots.

### globalFilterDots
Applies all the filters to a dictionary of dots and returns the filtered dots and the remaining dots.

### filtered_dots
Wrapper for globalFilterDots that combines all filtered dots into one array.

The `__main__` section provides examples and is mainly used for testing and processing specific dots data.
